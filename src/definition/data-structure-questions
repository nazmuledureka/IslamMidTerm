Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.-->It a way of organize data to store and retrieving effective way in your memory
     If we need to add, retrieve , delete or some other task need another data structure


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
--> we can use ArrayList so we do not need to set the initialize . It can grow dynamically
and we can use LinkedList so that we can add data easily into a linkedList also we can delete data easily.


List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
-->
    ArrayList
    LinkedLIst
    Stack
   Queue
   Map
   hashMap
   hashTable
   Graph
   Tree


what is an Array?
--> Array is a container and it  used to store multiple values in a single variable


what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
-->  Array is fixed size but ArrayList is not fixed . array need to initialize but ArrayList grow dynamically and
do not need to initialize.

what is LinkedList?
--> LinkedList is a another data structure and using LinkedList we can add data easily and delete data easily.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
-->

what is queue?
-->  queue is first  in first out


what is stack?
-->  Stack is  last in  first out data structure

what is FIFO and LIFO?
-->  FIFO - First if first out and LIFO- Last in first out.

what is the order of complexity?
-->

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
-->

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
-->

what is tree in data structure?
-->

what is graph in data structure?
-->

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
-->

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
-->

How HashMap works in java?
-->  HashMap key value pair. Map is interface of collection framework and implemented by hash map.


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
-->

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
-->

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
-->  Array is a container and it  used to store multiple values in a single variable. Array is fixed size and need to initialize
  LinkedList is a another data structure and using LinkedList we can add data easily and delete data easily.


What is DFS and BFS?
-->

What is Recursion?
-->

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
-->  LinkedList is the linear data structure .

What is Big-(O)-notation?
-->

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
-->

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
